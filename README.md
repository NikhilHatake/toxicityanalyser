# toxicityanalyser
I developed a machine learning model to identify toxic tweets with 93% accuracy. I preprocessed a balanced dataset from Kaggle, applying TF-IDF vectorization, and used the XGBoost algorithm for classification. This work highlights how machine learning can effectively mitigate social media toxicity.
